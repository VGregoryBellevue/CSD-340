<h1>Assignment 2.3 â€“ Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1:HTML</h2>
   
<p class="intro">Hello fellow readers, I am Victor Gregory, and some of my closest friends call me Vikko. I am currently working towards my Software Development degree through the Aspire or Guild program. <span class="sentence">I am a proud father of three wonderful children on the autism spectrum.</span></p> 

<p>I am a full-time cast member at the Walt Disney Travel Company, and occasionally, I work at a local gaming bar when they need coverage. In my free time, I enjoy running tabletop roleplaying games online or in person at the gaming bar where I work. I believe continuing one's education and striving for self-improvement is important, especially as a father of three children with medical needs. I want to ensure they are set up for success because life is precious and fleeting. My goal is to see them living independently with a circle of trustworthy people around them.</p>

<p>I am eager to gain more knowledge and understand each language covered in this class like HTML and CSS. This way, I can become a versatile and adaptable coder, capable of working with various technologies.</p>
